      <h2>Who's this guy?</h2>
      <p>I'm Andrew Verbenets. I'm the Front-end Developer.</p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™ve been building websites for over 2 years and live in Kiev.
        Currently I've built over 50 websites. Majority of them were built only with clear
        CSS and JS, some of them in CMS Wordpress and two the last in React.
