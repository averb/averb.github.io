          <p>My name is Andrew Verbenets.</p>
          <p>
            I'm working as front-end developer from 2015 and built more than 50 websites.
            Majority of them were made purely in HTML, CSS and JS. <br>
            Since 2017 I'm working with React.js.

            Every day I learn something new and grow as professional to make the world web better ;)
            I prefer to work remotely but also can work in the office if the company requires it.
